Viral compilation channels are one of the best fits for automation — the format is repetitive, the content is sourced not created, and the editing is templated. Done right, this prints content at scale.

### Architecture — YouTube Viral Compilation Pipeline

**Phase 1: Content Sourcing**
- Reddit API (top posts from target subreddits — r/askreddit, r/tifu, r/maliciouscompliance, etc.)
- Twitter/X trending threads
- Ranking algorithm: upvotes × comment ratio × recency
- Deduplication against previous videos

**Phase 2: Script Assembly**
- AI rewrites/narrates the source content (avoids copyright, adds flow)
- Intro hook → stories → transitions → CTA outro
- Target: 15-25 min runtime (algorith..."

### YouTube Viral Compilation Project — Status Report

| Component | Status | Detail |
|-----------|--------|--------|
| **Project folder** | ✅ Created | `C:\Users\tyson\Desktop\youtube-project\clips\` |
| **FFmpeg** | ✅ Ready | v8.0.1 installed |
| **yt-dlp** | ✅ Installed | v2026.02.21 (via `python -m yt_dlp`) |
| **Deno** | ✅ Installed | `C:\Users\tyson\.deno\bin\deno.exe` — needed for YouTube JS extraction |
| **Clip 01 download** | ⏳ In progress | "Funniest Unexpected Fails Feb 2026" — downloading first 3 min at 720p. ~70% through before session timeout |
| **Clip sources identified** | ✅ 5 candidates | Fails compilations, viral TikTok mashups, trending clips from this week |

### Blockers

1. **Download speed** — ~50-60 KB/s on this connection for YouTube. A 3-minute 720p clip takes ~2 minutes to download. Full pipeline will need patience or a faster route.
2. **Deno PATH** — installed but needs explicit path injection per session. Minor fix.
3. **No clips fully downloaded yet** — the first download was progressing (~68 seconds captured of 180) when the session timed out.

### Next Steps

1. Resume clip downloads (need 5-8 clips for a 10-15 min compilation)
2. Build the FFmpeg assembly script — cuts, transitions, captions, intro/outro
3. Generate thumbnail
4. Package final video to Desktop

Want me to continue the downloads now? The slow connection means this will take 15-20 minutes for all clips. Could run it as a background task.

Right. Viral clips compilation with high-quality editing, output to desktop. Let me refine the approach.

Before building — a few things to nail down, sir:

### Viral Clips Compilation — Refined Spec

**Content type:** Curated viral video clips (not Reddit stories — actual video clips)
**This changes the pipeline significantly:**

| Challenge | Reality |
|-----------|---------|
| **Source clips** | Need to download actual viral videos — TikTok, Twitter/X, Instagram Reels, YouTube Shorts |
| **Copyright** | This is the hard part. Compilation channels get struck...."

put it on my desktop once done
assistant: No completed clips from before. Restarting downloads now — running them in background.
assistant: Three clips downloading in parallel. Let me also search for a couple more short viral clips to round it out.
assistant: Five downloads running in parallel. Let me check progress in a minute.
assistant: Clip 1 done. Let me check the others.
assistant: Three down. Checking the remaining two.
assistant: Clip 5 is at ~1:32 of 3:00 — about halfway. Let me start building the FFmpeg assembly script while it finishes, then combine everything.
assistant: Four clips ready, fifth downloading. Let me write the assembly script now and wait for clip 5.
