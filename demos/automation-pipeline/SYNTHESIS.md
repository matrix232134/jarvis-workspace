# Research Pipeline Synthesis: Automation Platform for JARVIS

> **Pipeline:** 3 parallel sub-agents with live web search
> **Total runtime:** ~85s (longest agent) | **Total tokens:** ~75k across 3 agents
> **All agents ran simultaneously on Claude Opus 4.6**

## Executive Summary

Install **n8n** (`npx n8n`). It has native MCP support built-in, runs on your existing Node.js, has first-class Telegram and webhook nodes, and integrates bidirectionally with JARVIS via REST API and webhooks. No other tool comes close for your setup.

## Why n8n Wins

| Factor | n8n | Runner-up (Node-RED) |
|--------|-----|---------------------|
| Install on Windows | `npx n8n` — zero config | `npm i -g node-red` — also trivial |
| MCP Support | **Native MCP Server Trigger built-in** | Community nodes only |
| Telegram | Native node (trigger + send) | Community node |
| Webhooks | First-class, configurable response timing | HTTP-in nodes |
| REST API | Full CRUD + execution management | Admin API available |
| RAM | ~200-400MB | ~50-150MB (lighter) |
| Integrations | 400+ native | 5000+ community |

**The MCP finding is the differentiator.** n8n workflows can be exposed as MCP tools natively — meaning JARVIS could eventually call n8n workflows as if they were built-in capabilities, no custom integration code needed.

## MCP Ecosystem Summary

| Category | Servers Found | Best for Sir |
|----------|--------------|--------------|
| Workflow platforms | 5 (n8n: 2, Node-RED: 3) | n8n MCP Server Trigger (built-in) |
| Telegram | 4 | telegram-bot-mcp (npx, simple) |
| Scheduling | 4 | Already covered by OpenClaw cron |
| Webhooks | 2 | Not needed — n8n handles this |

## Integration Architecture

```
JARVIS ──webhook POST──► n8n (:5678)
JARVIS ◄──HTTP callback── n8n (on completion)
JARVIS ──heartbeat GET──► n8n API (every 15min)
```

- Correlation IDs track every request-response pair
- Dual alert: n8n → Telegram direct (backup) + n8n → JARVIS → processed alert
- Error handling: timeout detection, retry logic, execution history queries

## Phased Rollout

### Phase 1: Install & Validate (~10 min)
- [ ] `npx n8n` — verify UI at localhost:5678
- [ ] Create test webhook workflow
- [ ] Test JARVIS → n8n webhook trigger

### Phase 2: Core Integration (~30 min)
- [ ] Configure n8n API key
- [ ] Add n8n health check to JARVIS heartbeat
- [ ] Build callback pattern (n8n → OpenClaw gateway)
- [ ] Set up Telegram notification node in n8n

### Phase 3: MCP Integration (Future)
- [ ] Enable n8n MCP Server Trigger
- [ ] Register n8n workflows as MCP tools in OpenClaw
- [ ] JARVIS calls n8n workflows conversationally

## What This Demo Showed

| Capability | Status |
|------------|--------|
| Parallel sub-agents | ✅ 3 agents ran simultaneously |
| Live web research per agent | ✅ Each agent searched independently |
| Agent result collection | ✅ All 3 results retrieved via sessions_history |
| Cross-agent synthesis | ✅ Findings combined into actionable plan |
| File output pipeline | ✅ 4 structured markdown files |
