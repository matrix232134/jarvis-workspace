# Research Pipeline Synthesis: AI Long-Format Video Editing

> **Pipeline:** 3 research threads with live Tavily search (6 queries + 1 extraction)
> **Sub-agents:** Gateway timed out — ran single-threaded with identical research methodology
> **Topic:** AI-powered long-format video editing for solo creator on Windows 11

## Executive Summary

Build an automated pipeline from **free, local tools**: FFmpeg + Whisper + Auto-Editor + PySceneDetect. This handles ~85% of the editing work automatically (ingest, transcribe, silence removal, scene detection, captions, export). The remaining 15% — creative rough cut decisions — stays with sir. For interactive editing, **DaVinci Resolve Free** is the powerhouse; **Descript** is the alternative if transcript-based editing appeals.

A **60-tool MCP video editor** exists on GitHub that could give JARVIS direct video editing capabilities.

## The Stack

| Layer | Tool | Cost | Purpose |
|-------|------|------|---------|
| Foundation | **FFmpeg** | Free | All video processing |
| Transcription | **Whisper** (local) | Free | Word-level timestamps, captions |
| Auto-editing | **Auto-Editor** | Free | Silence removal, motion-based cuts |
| Scene detection | **PySceneDetect** | Free | Scene boundary identification |
| Interactive edit | **DaVinci Resolve Free** | Free | Human review of rough cut |
| MCP integration | **mcp-video-editor** | Free | 60 tools for JARVIS to call |

**Total cost: $0.** All open source, all run locally on Windows.

## Pipeline Flow

```
Raw footage (1-2 hrs)
  → FFmpeg normalize
  → Whisper transcribe (5-15 min on GPU)
  → Auto-Editor silence removal (3-5 min)
  → PySceneDetect scene boundaries (2 min)
  → ★ HUMAN REVIEW rough cut ★
  → Whisper captions → SRT embed
  → FFmpeg audio enhance + export
```

**~85% automated.** JARVIS runs steps 1-4 and 6-8. Sir reviews step 5.

## Key Findings

1. **mcp-video-editor** (60 MCP tools) — wraps FFmpeg comprehensively in Go. Could let JARVIS trim, concat, add effects, overlay text, and manage timelines conversationally.
2. **Descript** charges by transcription hours (40hr/mo on Pro at $33/mo) — viable but costs add up for heavy use.
3. **DaVinci Resolve Free** has no time/length limits — best for the actual editing step.
4. **Auto-Editor** is the automation gem — `pip install auto-editor`, one command removes all dead air.
5. **CapCut** has a 60-minute limit — eliminated for long-format.
6. **Runway ML** is for generative clips, not long-format editing.

## MCP Ecosystem

| Server | Tools | Key Feature |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| **mcp-video-editor** | 60 | Full FFmpeg + Whisper + AI vision |
| **video-audio-mcp** | ~15 | Basic FFmpeg + Whisper |
| **MCP-YouTube-Transcribe** | 1 | YouTube transcript + whisper.cpp |

## Phased Rollout

### Phase 1: Install Foundation (~10 min)
- [ ] `choco install ffmpeg` (or download)
- [ ] `pip install openai-whisper auto-editor scenedetect[opencv]`
- [ ] Test: `auto-editor test-clip.mp4 --margin 0.3s`

### Phase 2: JARVIS Integration
- [ ] Create a shell script / skill wrapping the pipeline
- [ ] JARVIS triggers via: "Process footage at C:\Videos\raw\*.mp4"
- [ ] Auto-alert when rough cut is ready for review

### Phase 3: MCP Integration (Optional)
- [ ] Install mcp-video-editor (Go binary)
- [ ] Register as MCP server in OpenClaw
- [ ] JARVIS edits video conversationally: "Trim the first 30 seconds and add captions"
